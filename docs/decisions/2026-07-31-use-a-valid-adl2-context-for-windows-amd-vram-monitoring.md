# 2026-07-31 — Use a valid ADL2 context for Windows AMD VRAM monitoring

- **Context:** Windows AMD GPU discovery and total VRAM enumeration work through Vulkan, but live VRAM polling fails because the hardware plugin resolves non-existent camel-cased ADL exports and calls an ADL2 query with a null context. The always-on five-second status poll then repeats a non-actionable debug message.
- **Decision:** Use the documented ADL2 exports and one context lifecycle for enumeration and dedicated-VRAM queries. Serialize ADL calls, release the context through RAII on every exit path, check every ADL status, and log repeated probe failure only once per process.
- **Consequences:** Windows AMD live VRAM telemetry can operate independently of Vulkan discovery without flooding logs. The implementation remains dependent on the AMD driver-provided ADL DLL and still falls back to unavailable live statistics when ADL cannot initialize.
