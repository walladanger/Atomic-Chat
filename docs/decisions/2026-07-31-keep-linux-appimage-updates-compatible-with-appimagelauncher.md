# 2026-07-31 — Keep Linux AppImage updates compatible with AppImageLauncher

- **Context:** AppImageLauncher cannot mount the zstd SquashFS emitted by the continuously published `appimagetool`. On relaunch, AppRun's inherited `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` can also make the host AppImageLauncher load Radium Chat's bundled OpenSSL instead of the system library. Together these failures left updated installations unable to launch in issue #164.
- **Decision:** Assemble the release AppImage from the type-2 runtime and a gzip SquashFS, and strip AppImage runtime variables before relaunching an AppImage.
- **Consequences:** Linux release builders require `squashfs-tools`. Relaunch preserves the user's session environment while removing paths into the old AppImage mount.
