# 2026-05-19 — Product identity is "Radium Chat"; new code stops carrying Jan branding

- **Context:** The repo is a hard fork of `janhq/jan`. Existing artefacts
  (root `package.json` `name: jan-app`, `@janhq/*` workspaces, `jan-cli`
  binary, `pre-install/janhq-*.tgz`, Windows APPDATA folders) still carry
  Jan names because renaming any of them would break installer migrations
  and existing user data on disk.
- **Decision:** Radium Chat is the product. **All new** features, modules,
  package names, identifiers, env vars, log prefixes, telemetry events,
  user-facing copy, and docs use Radium Chat — never Jan. Existing legacy
  names stay until a dedicated migration task renames them with a proper
  data-migration plan.
- **Consequences:** Clear forward direction without breaking installed
  users; some short-term inconsistency between legacy and new naming is
  accepted. Future migration tasks (rename CLI, repackage extensions,
  consolidate APPDATA folders, change repo URL in `Cargo.toml`) will each
  get their own ADR entry.
- **Owner:** team.
