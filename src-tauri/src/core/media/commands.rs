//! Tauri commands for media provider credentials.
//!
//! Desktop only, and deliberately the narrowest surface that works: set, get,
//! delete, plus one question about whether storage exists at all.
//!
//! There is no "list all credentials" command. Enumeration would let anything
//! able to invoke a command sweep every key the user has stored, which is a
//! capability the app itself does not need — the frontend always knows the
//! `setting_key` it is asking about, because the provider descriptor carries it.
