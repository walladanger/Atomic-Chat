 *
 * The two membership predicates are exact complements on purpose. Settings
 * renders `isLocalEngineProvider`, `/cloud` renders `isCloudProvider`, and
 * because neither can be true at the same time and neither can be false at the
 * same time, no provider can end up in no UI at all. That is not hypothetical:
 * `ollama` is a remote-transport provider on a loopback URL, so a name-only
 * "is it local" filter would strand it. It lands under Cloud → Self-hosted.
 *
 * "Connected" is derived, never persisted. `active` keeps its own meaning
 * ("enabled / show in the model picker") for local and cloud alike, and the
 * condition below is the same one `syncRemoteProviders`,
 * `ensureRemoteProviderReady` and `DropdownModelProvider` already evaluate — so
 * there is nothing new to keep in sync and nothing to migrate.
