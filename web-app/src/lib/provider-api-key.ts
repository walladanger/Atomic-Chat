/**
 * What "the user gave us an API key" means, in one place.
 *
 * Both the provider settings page and onboarding's cloud-provider dialog write
 * keys, and they must agree: the key lives in two places at once — inside the
 * `api-key` entry of `provider.settings[]` (what the settings UI renders) and
 * on the top-level `api_key` mirror (what the chat, the onboarding gate and
 * `switchToModel` read). Writing one without the other yields a provider that
 * looks configured but cannot send a request, or vice versa.
 *
 * `duringOnboarding` is a required parameter rather than being derived here on
 * purpose: `isOnboardingPending` pulls in `provider-registry-store`, which
 * kicks off a network fetch at import time. Keeping that out of this module
 * lets onboarding components import it without dragging a fetch into their
 * import graph.

/**
 * Copy of `settings` with the `api-key` entry's value replaced.
 *
 * Immutable down to the entry being changed — the settings page's own handler
 * mutates `controller_props` through a shallow copy, which edits the object the
 * previous state still points at. Not a bug worth chasing there, but not one to
 * reproduce here either.
 *
 * Returns the input unchanged when the provider declares no `api-key` setting.
