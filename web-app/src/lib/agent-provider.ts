 *    text JSON array carried by the prompt (plus a JSON schema where the target
 *    accepts one). Gating on it would also block every model missing from the
 *    static `getModelCapabilities` table, including custom providers.
 *  - Whether a model is selected and loaded is checked at run time, so the
 *    sidebar toggle is not greyed out before the user has picked one.
 *  - Keyless loopback providers (Ollama, LM Studio) are allowed. They travel
 *    the same proxy path as cloud providers — `DataProvider` registers them on
 *    exactly the condition used here — and the proxy needs no upstream key for
 *    them.
 *
 * Cloud models route through the Local API Server proxy, which is started on
 * demand by `ensureRemoteProviderReady`; a stopped server is therefore not a
 * reason to block either. The backend still fails closed with
 * `AGENT_LOCAL_SERVER_REQUIRED` if the start does not take.
 *
 * Returns `null` when nothing blocks the run.
